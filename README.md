Hey!
	
Here's my first and incomplete version
of my dracula ricing on arch linux

IMPORTANT: for custom images (like ascii from neofetch) you have to change the path in the config file
There are still confusing/missing things,
and also portugese phrases on the comments,
but i plan to fix that.

WM: Sway

Bar: Waybar

Shell: Bash

Term: Kitty

Font: FiraCode
